This project is to create a simulation of SPECT and PET images from an X-ray absorption dataset.

SPECT Simulation: Simulate sinogram and image reconstructions for simulated gamma camera data.
PET Simulation: Simulate sinogram and image reconstructions for simulated PET data.
Advanced PET Simulation: Simulate a transmission scan and use this to improve the PET image reconstruction.
